This README will hold important notes such as simplifying assumptions and other comments.

Simplifying assumptions (to remove code which is irrelevant to what we are trying to provide with this code):
  - We assume that users always give valid input, such as valid indices for our ArrayLists.
  - In GetSetIncAll we only accept integers as values, but this can easily be replicated for doubles, floats or other types which support incrementing.
